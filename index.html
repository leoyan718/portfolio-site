      <p>Leo Yan is from the Bay Area and is an upcoming 4th year student of SJSU majoring in Digital Media Art. He discovered his interest in digital media in high school when he enrolled in a Computer Art class during freshman year. In that class, he learned about the basics of digital art including how to use softwares such as Photoshop and iMovie. From then throughout his sophomore to senior years, he participated in the Digital Media Design Academy in his school learning all sorts of new things. He discovered many applications and softwares to make art throughout the years. But he was introduced to Blender during the lockdown pandemic of 2020 and was interested in pursuing that software. He started using Blender to make thumbnails and pose video game models through character rigging. And ever since then and during his freshman year of college where he learned more about Blender, he knew it was his favorite software to work in yet.
